        <p class="mt-3">
          Collagen is among the most abundant proteins in the body. It actually
          makes up for 30% of all the protein in your body, and most of the
          protein in your skin – 75% total.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-1">
          Collagen is a protein made up of long chains of linked amino acids.
          It’s actually the most abundant source of protein in our entire body.
          We can think of collagen as a foundational building block, providing
          strength and structure for our connective tissues.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-1">
          <b>In our adult years, our bodies begin to produce less collagen</b>.
          This process begins when we are around the age of 30 and accelerates
          in our 40s – leading to the inevitable visual and noticeable signs of
          aging. Collagen loss is a natural process, but other factors such as
          exposure to UV, pollution, and lifestyle choices can lead to early or
          more intense signs of aging.

          The importance of Collagen in our bodies is huge but, naturally, as we

          bones and muscles.

          <h4 class="Subtitulo">Muscles</h4>
          <p>
            As we age the amount of collagen in the connective tissue declines,
            this tissue is responsible for bundling muscle fibers into a strong
            and functioning muscle. It is only natural to get older but our
            muscle´s strength and function decreases, affecting our balance,
            gait, and overall mobility.

          <h4 class="Subtitulo">Bones</h4>
          <p>
            Our bones get weaker as collagen levels and the content of minerals
            decrease. With time, this causes them to become more fragile and
            breakable.

            Aging wears and tears on the joint cartilage, reducing their

            for us to stay active as we age.

            Our nails require a variety of nutrients including protein, vitamins

            start lacking these nutrients.

          <p>
            As hair grows out of skin, it is important to understand that the
            aging of our skin also affects our hair. Collagen contributes to the
            elasticity and strength of our dermis. With age, our bodies become
            less efficient at producing collagen and replenishing cells in the
            dermis.

            A decline in your body’s production of collagen, elastin and

            skin. Both internal and external factors damage skin and have an
            effect on its appearance.

              When your body is under physical and emotional stress its ability

              Glutamine also speeds healing following injury, stress, infection,
              surgery, burns and most major illnesses thanks to its involvement
              in both cellular turnover and repair and stimulation of immune
              cells.
