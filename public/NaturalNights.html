        <p class="mt-3">
          <strong>Sleep deprivation</strong> is caused by consistent lack of
          sleep or reduced quality of sleep. Getting less than 7 hours of sleep
          on a regular basis can eventually lead to health consequences that
          affect your entire body. During sleep, your body heals itself and
          restores its chemical balance. Your brain forges new thought
          connections and helps memory retention. Without enough sleep, your
          brain and body systems won’t function normally.

          <h4>Excessive sleepiness</h4>
          <p>
            The most common causes of excessive sleepiness are sleep deprivation
            and disorders like sleep apnea and insomnia. Depression, certain
            medications, and medical conditions affecting the brain and body can
            cause daytime drowsiness as well.

          />
          <h4>Frequent yawning.</h4>
          <p>
            When we are tired, we just don't breathe as deeply as we usually do.
            Our bodies take in less oxygen because our breathing has slowed.
            Therefore, yawning helps us bring more oxygen into the blood and
            move more carbon dioxide out of the blood.

          <h4>Irritability</h4>
          <p>
            Lack of sleep can alter your mood significantly. It causes
            irritability and anger and may lessen your ability to cope with
            stress. So not getting enough sleep affects the way you feel, think,
            work, learn and get along with other people.

            When you do not get enough sleep, you feel tired, you find it hard
            to concentrate and remember things and you may be grumpy. Feeling
            fatigue can also impair your judgement and impact your physical
            coordination.

          Besides, chronic sleep deprivation can interfere with your body’s

            Your central nervous system is the main information highway of your
            body. Sleep is necessary to keep it functioning properly, but
            chronic insomnia can disrupt how your body usually sends and
            processes information. Lack of sleep also affects your mental
            abilities and emotional state.

        <button class="accordion">Immune system</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>
            During sleep our immune system produces protective,
            infection-fighting substances to combat foreign invaders such as
            bacteria and viruses. Sleep deprivation prevents your immune system
            from building up its forces.

            As you wake up throughout the night, this can cause sleep
            deprivation, which leaves you more vulnerable to respiratory
            infections like the common cold and flu.

            Sleep affects the levels of two hormones, leptin and ghrelin, which
            control feelings of hunger and fullness. Without enough sleep, your
            brain reduces leptin and raises ghrelin, which is an appetite
            stimulant. Lack of sleep is also associated with glucose intolerance
            and insulin resistance.

            Sleep affects processes that keep your heart and blood vessels
            healthy, including those that affect your blood sugar, blood
            pressure, and inflammation levels. It also plays a vital role in
            your body’s ability to heal and repair the blood vessels and heart.

          Restful sleep helps detoxify your brain, boosts your metabolism and
