        <p>
          <strong>Digestive diseases</strong> are disorders of the digestive
          tract. In digestion, food and drink are broken down into small parts
          (called nutrients) that the body can absorb and use as energy and
          building blocks for cells. The digestive tract is made up of the
          esophagus (food tube), stomach, large and small intestines, liver,
          pancreas, and the gallbladder.

          <h4>Diet low in fiber & High in dairy</h4>
          <p>
            Food low in fiber takes longer to digest leading to irregular bowel
            movement, loose stools and can also cause stomach pain. The
            consumption of too much dairy products can cause bloating and
            digestive stress even if you are not lactose intolerant.

          <h4>Taking antacid medicines and overusing laxatives.</h4>
          <p>
            Disturbances of gut motility occur frequently under a high dose
            antacid regimen and the typical symptoms are diarrhea and
            constipation. Also, the overuse of laxatives can lead to dehydration
            and mineral deficiencies and can also cause long-term and
            potentially permanent damage to the digestive system.

          <h4>Inactivity, Dehydration & Stress</h4>
          <p>
            Stress can affect how quickly food moves through the body which can
            cause either diarrhea or constipation. It can also affect digestion,
            and what nutrients the intestines absorb. Inactivity and dehydration
            can make constipation worse and it typically causes heartburn and
            reflux.

          <h4>Traveling or other changes in routine.</h4>
          <p>
            Changes in routine can be exciting and stressful. Both are emotional
            states not entirely conducive to the relaxed state needed for
            healthy digestion causing different types of digestive issues such
            as constipation and loss of appetite.
