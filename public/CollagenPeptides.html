          Why does collagen production decrease after we turn 20?

        <p class="mt-3">
          <b>In our twenties, the skin’s exfoliation process decreases by 28%</b
          >. This means our dead skin cells stick together for longer periods of
          time. In our thirties, the transfer of moisture from the dermis to the
          epidermis is slowed and fat cells begin to shrink. These effects
          <b>make the skin look dull and thin</b>. In our forties, collagen has
          been reduced significantly – meaning the collagen and elastin fibres
          break, losing their elasticity in the process. Finally, in our
          fifties, the skin becomes dry and is easily bruised as the sebaceous
          glands (which produce oil) have decreased in size. In women, menopause
          also decreases oestrogen levels, leaving the skin drier and less
          toned.

          <p>
            As we age the amount of collagen in the connective tissue declines,
            this tissue is responsible for bundling muscle fibers into a strong
            and functioning muscle. It is only natural to get older but our
            muscle´s strength and function decreases, affecting our balance,
            gait, and overall mobility.

            As hair grows out of skin, it is important to understand that the

            elasticity and strength of our dermis. With age, our bodies become
            less efficient at producing collagen and replenishing cells in the
            dermis.

          <b>Collagen peptides</b> are short chains of amino acids extracted
          from native collagen via a process called enzymatic hydrolysis.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-1">
          Therefore, the native collagen has to go through a softening process
          that allows the collagen peptides to be released from their bonds and
          safely extracted. At a molecular level, collagen is made up of
          <b>three long amino acid chains</b> that form a triple helix with a
          high molecular weight. As a result, the collagen peptides are locked
          up in a tough and insoluble matrix of collagen fibers.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-1">
          The collagen then goes through a process called enzymatic hydrolysis.
          This is where a specific enzyme is used to break down the peptide
          bonds so the collagen peptides can be extracted. The hydrolyzation
          process breaks down the collagen protein’s amino acid chains. This
          makes the nutrients easier and faster to digest for our bodies. By
